#About
This is a tool for translating from css3 keyframes to javascript object.
The origin discussion is from [javascript-degradation-solutions-for-css3-animations](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6048167/javascript-degradation-solutions-for-css3-animations) ,
I think keyframes is a better way to write animations.
If using javascript way, it is harder to maintain it.
However, the most troublesome problem is IE doesn't support keyframes until IE10.
We can't wait IE disappearing from the world. So we still need to find a solution for IE.
Just use keyframes thinking on making animation, and use this tool for fixing fallback solution.
